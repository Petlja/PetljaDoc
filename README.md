# PetljaDoc - Petlja's tools for interactive books

Tools are based on https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneComponents and https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx and includes:

- additional Sphinx extensions 
- partial Pygame implementation for Sculpt (https://github.com/Petlja/pygame4skulpt)
- additional ActiveCode features
- customized Sphinx theme 
- customized project tempate and CLI command for starting a new project with the template

PetljaDoc currenty depends on forked RunestoneComonents, but we are gradually closing the gap with the upstream repository through pull requests.
